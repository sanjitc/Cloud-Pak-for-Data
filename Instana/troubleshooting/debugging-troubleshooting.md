## Mustgather
For "error" or "troubleshooting" issues, proactively capture the required must-gather data and upload it to the ticket.
Include the date and time when the issue occurred. Ensure the must-gather captured covers the time when the issue was reproduced.
### Must-Gather Resources:
- Collect must-gather data for Self-hosted Instana backend environments (Kubernetes/OpenShift):
